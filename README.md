# TMDB-Data-insight

This is a personal project which gives me insight in all data wanted about movies and their actors. 

It uses the TMDB API so if you want to use this script get an API key first:
https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

Once you've got an API key we need an excel document to load into the script.
The only thing you really need in this excel document are 2 rows named "Movie Title" and "Year of release"
Note that the movie title needs to be spelled the same as the one on TMDB. Extra white space and capital letters do not matter. I am planning on making this more bulletproof in the future.

What do you need to run this?
- pandas 
pandas is used to load the excel document into python. You can install pandas by doing the following:
`pip install pandas` 

Any suggestions for what to add are welcome!

Also the code isn't the best or most optimized any suggestions to improve the code are welcome aswell.
